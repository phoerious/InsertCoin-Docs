# InsertCoin ROM Docs

Welcome to the official InsertCoin ROM documentation project. It is a community
project which everyone can contribute to. If you like you can take part as well.
It's open to anybody. We'd love to hear from you.

## Important things to know
InsertCoin is a custom ROM for HTC phones cooked by *baadnewz*. You can always find
the latest versions on [insertcoin-roms.org](http://insertcoin-roms.org/)
with short instructions about requirements and changelog.

### Discussion platforms
For discussion about InsertCoin head over to
[XDA-Developers.com](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1198684)
where many development related discussions take place. If you have questions,
suggestions or bug reports, you may probably post them there.

InsertCoin also has its own forum at
[rootzwiki.com](http://rootzwiki.com/forumdisplay.php?301-Bricked-Kernel-InsertCoin-ROM).

If you want to chat with other InsertCoin ROM users, use the IRC channel *#baadnwz-roms*
on *irc.freenode.net*. Also baad is there quite frequently.

An [XDA-Developers thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=17329560)
for this documentation also exists. You may use that for discussion related to the docs,
but better open an entry in our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Manko10/InsertCoin-Docs/issues).

### Contributors
And of course we would also like to mention all the contributors who have worked
on this project. You'll find a list in the [credits](/master/en-US/credits.html).

## About this documentation
This is the documentation for the latest **Ice Cream Sandwich** InsertCoin ROM branch
with Sense 3.5. *This branch is currently beta. Don't expect it to run flawlessly!*
This ROM is pretty stable but if you need an even more stable version,
you should go for InsertCoin 2.2.5 SSE (this version is quite old, though).

There are several variants for Sensation, Desire and EVO as well as older versions
of these variants. Have a look at the branches list in the sidebar at the left.

## How can I contribute?
The documentation is maintained in a Git repository, which is hosted on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/).
To find out how to make your own changes to the docs read the tutorials in our little
[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/Manko10/InsertCoin-Docs/wiki).
